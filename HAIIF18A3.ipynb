    "So what's happening here? \"model\" is a Pipeline object. It's defined in the \"model = ...\" block, and used with model.fit(X, y). It works by taking whatever you put into it, in this case X, and y, and running them through each step in the Pipeline. Typically this means each step until the last will transform the data in some way, and the last step will fit a classifier to the transformed data. Once a Pipeline is finished, you can use it by calling one of the methods *of the final function in the pipeline*. For example, in order to call model.fit(X,y), the last function in the Pipeline needs to be a classifier as transformers don't have the .fit() method.\n",

    "1. It compresses a lot of code into a short, neat block.\n",
    "2. It's easy to plop in or switch out different types of classifiers or transformers.\n",
    "3. You only have to tell it what input data to use once at the very beginning. It knows to take the output of the first step and automatically input it into the second step, etc. etc.\n",
    "4. You can easily access the data from every step of the process even after the process is complete. Pipeline stores them according to the name you gave the step.\n",
    "5. You can easily re-use it. Instead of writing the code to clean/classify data each time, you can just call the Pipeline you've written. You could actually define a single Pipeline creation function in a file somewhere and just call it every time you do a particular type of project (e.g., text classification), and then you could clean/classify all in one line in every project just by importing and calling that Pipeline. If you want to edit your Pipeline process, you'd only have to update that one function and then all of your projects would subsequently use the same new Pipeline. \n",

The basis of these attributes comes from MTurk worker ratings, but a variety of fancy math led to the values they have now. You can see the full file with attributes for all of the 13,000+ images in the dataset [here](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/databases/pubfig/download/lfw_attributes.txt). \n",

If you look in this csv file, you can see that images of Bush are generally labeled with values > 0 in the dataset for Male, White, and not wearing lipstick, and < 0 for Black, Baby, and Heavy Makeup. Seems reasonable, as Bush is White and Male and doesn't usually wear lipstick. For whatever it's worth, the average \"Attractive Man\" score for Bush is slightly higher than the overall average in the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset.\n",

A reasonable-ish (though low-quality result) exercise would be to use this to predict attributes of other images in the dataset.
